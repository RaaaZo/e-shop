## E-Shop Page

E-commerce page where You're able to buy things without sign in. But then You won't get purchase history, so i recommend to sign in before make an order. As in the previous project Front-end is written in React (used Redux and formik and some minor React libraries), Backend in Express.js, and I used MongoDB as a database.
